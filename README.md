- JWT tokens for secure API authentication
- HTTPS required in production
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- GDPR and financial regulation compliance features

## 📝 Development Guidelines

- Follow secure coding practices
- Write comprehensive tests for all features
- Document all API endpoints
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regular dependency updates and security scans
