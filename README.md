## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js, Express, **fido2-lib** for passkeys  
- Frontend: React 18  
- Database: PostgreSQL 14+ with row-level security  
- Session storage: Redis (prod) / memory (dev)  
- Email: Nodemailer with Gmail/SMTP  

## Development & Testing

- Run development server (frontend + backend):  
  `npm run dev`
- Run all tests:  
  `npm test`  
- Manage DB and users with utility scripts in `/scripts/`

## Troubleshooting

- Conflicting ports or hung servers? Run: 
pkill -f "react-scripts"; pkill -f "nodemon"
npm run dev
- Missing frontend files? Run setup again:  
`npm run setup`
- Check `.env` and port settings if frontend or backend doesn‚Äôt start properly.
