# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the Secure Asset Portal.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP-based 2FA using Google Authenticator
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity rules
- **JWT Token Security**: Short-lived tokens with secure signing
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout and secure session handling
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage

### Infrastructure Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate configs for different environments

### Audit & Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking
- **Data Access Controls**: Role-based permissions
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access controls
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data privacy and deletion capabilities

## Development Security Practices

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis and security testing
- Secure coding standards and peer reviews
- Input sanitization and output encoding

### Deployment Security
- Environment variable management
- Container security scanning
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting

## Security Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning completed

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Documentation**: Record incident details
